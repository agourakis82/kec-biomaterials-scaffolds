          "output": "CYP2D6*4/*4 (poor metabolizer) pharmacogenomic strategy: 1) Risperidone dosing: Reduce initial dose by 50-75% (0.25mg BID vs 1mg BID), maximum 2-3mg daily vs 6mg in normal metabolizers. 2) Quantum pharmacology effects: CYP2D6*4 alters electron transport chain kinetics in hepatic microsomes, reducing proton tunneling efficiency by ~60%, leading to 5-10x higher plasma concentrations. 3) Alternative considerations: Switch to ziprasidone (CYP3A4-dependent, unaffected by CYP2D6), or asenapine (glucuronidation pathway). 4) Monitoring: Enhanced EPS surveillance, prolactin levels q3months, ECG for QTc prolongation. 5) Therapeutic drug monitoring if available (target 9-hydroxerisperidone:risperidone ratio <1 indicates poor metabolism). 6) Patient education on genetic variation, slower medication onset expected, enhanced sensitivity to side effects."

          "output": "Quantum tunneling in CYP450 enzymes: 1) Mechanism: Proton and hydrogen atom tunneling in heme-mediated oxidation reactions, electron tunneling through protein matrix affects substrate binding and product formation. 2) Temperature dependence: Tunneling increases at lower body temperatures (hypothermia, elderly patients), can increase metabolic rate by 10-20%. 3) Isotope effects: Deuterium substitution in drugs shows 2-8x slower metabolism due to reduced tunneling probability (kinetic isotope effect). 4) Clinical implications: Individual quantum efficiency variations contribute to 30-50% of pharmacokinetic variability beyond genetic polymorphisms. 5) Magnetic field sensitivity: Rare patients show altered drug metabolism in high magnetic field environments (MRI exposure). 6) Practical applications: Deuterated drugs (deutetrabenazine) exploit tunneling effects for improved pharmacokinetics, precision dosing models should incorporate quantum mechanical parameters alongside traditional PK/PD modeling."
