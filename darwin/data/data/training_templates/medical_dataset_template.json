Family history of bipolar disorder (mother). What is your differential diagnosis and recommended approach?",
          "output": "Differential diagnosis: 1) Major Depressive Disorder, moderate-severe episode (primary consideration given PHQ-9=18, classic symptoms). 2) Bipolar I/II Disorder, depressive episode (family history significant risk factor). 3) Adjustment disorder with depressed mood (if identifiable stressor). 4) Substance-induced mood disorder (requires toxicology screen). 5) Medical causes: thyroid dysfunction, B12 deficiency, sleep apnea. Recommended approach: 1) Complete psychiatric assessment including mania/hypomania screening (MDQ, YMRS), 2) Laboratory workup: TSH, B12, CBC, CMP, 3) Substance use screening, 4) Risk assessment for suicide/self-harm, 5) Consider pharmacogenomic testing before medication initiation given family history, 6) If MDD confirmed: initiate SSRI (escitalopram 10mg daily) + CBT referral, 7) Close follow-up in 1-2 weeks, monitor for treatment-emergent mania."

Risk stratification using TIMI Risk Score: Age 45(0), ≥3 risk factors(1), known CAD(0), aspirin use(0), severe angina(1), ST deviation(0), elevated cardiac markers(1) = TIMI 3 (moderate risk). Workup: 1) Serial troponins q6h x3, 2) Echocardiogram (wall motion abnormalities), 3) Lipid panel, HbA1c, PT/PTT, 4) Chest X-ray, 5) Coronary angiography within 24-48h (moderate risk). Management: 1) Dual antiplatelet therapy: aspirin 325mg + clopidogrel 600mg loading dose, then 75mg daily, 2) Anticoagulation: enoxaparin 1mg/kg q12h, 3) Beta-blocker: metoprolol 25mg BID (if no contraindications), 4) High-intensity statin: atorvastatin 80mg daily, 5) ACE inhibitor if LV dysfunction, 6) Diabetes management optimization, 7) Smoking cessation counseling + pharmacotherapy, 8) Cardiac rehabilitation referral."

Recommended strategy: 1) First-line: olanzapine 5mg daily (normal metabolism), titrate based on response/tolerability, 2) Monitor metabolic parameters closely (weight, glucose, lipids), 3) If risperidone needed: start 0.25mg BID, maximum 3mg daily (vs. 6mg in normal metabolizers), 4) Enhanced monitoring for extrapyramidal symptoms, 5) Consider therapeutic drug monitoring if available, 6) Patient education about genetic variation and medication sensitivity, 7) Document genotype in medical record for future prescribing, 8) Family counseling regarding potential genetic implications."

          "output": "Pharmacogenomic-guided warfarin dosing: Genotype analysis: CYP2C9*2/*3 (intermediate metabolizer, reduced clearance) + VKORC1 -1639A/A (low expression, high sensitivity) = significantly reduced warfarin requirements. Predicted dose: ~2-3mg daily (vs. 5-7mg for normal genotype). Dosing strategy: 1) Initial dose: 2.5mg daily x3 days, 2) Check INR on day 4, target INR 2.0-3.0, 3) Expect therapeutic INR earlier (day 3-5 vs. day 7-10), 4) Dose adjustments in 0.5mg increments, 5) Weekly INR monitoring x4 weeks, then every 2 weeks until stable, 6) Enhanced bleeding risk monitoring, 7) Drug interaction counseling (avoid NSAIDs, limit alcohol, consistent vitamin K intake), 8) Consider alternative anticoagulants (apixaban, rivaroxaban) if complex management anticipated. Expected outcomes: 30-40% dose reduction vs. clinical dosing, faster time to therapeutic INR, reduced bleeding risk with appropriate monitoring."

          "output": "Patient risk factors impact biomaterial selection: 1) Age 65: slower bone turnover, reduced osteoblast activity, 2) Osteoporosis (T-score -2.8): compromised bone quality, high fracture risk, 3) Diabetes: impaired wound healing, increased infection risk, altered bone metabolism. Biomaterial evaluation: 1) Autograft (gold standard) - pros: osteogenic/inductive/conductive, cons: donor site morbidity, limited quantity in osteoporotic patient, 2) Allograft - pros: unlimited supply, cons: no osteogenic potential, potential disease transmission, 3) Synthetic options: hydroxyapatite + tricalcium phosphate composites (osteoconductive, predictable resorption), BMP-2 enhanced scaffolds (osteoinductive, compensates for age-related decline). Recommendation: Synthetic HA/TCP scaffold + recombinant BMP-2 (low dose 0.43mg/mL to minimize complications) + local autograft if available. Monitoring: Sequential CT scans at 3, 6, 12 months for fusion assessment, glucose optimization pre/post-operatively, calcium/vitamin D supplementation, bisphosphonate therapy consideration post-healing."

Current evidence-based approaches: 1) Medication optimization: augmentation with lithium (300-600mg daily), aripiprazole (2-15mg daily), or quetiapine (150-300mg daily), 2) Switch strategies: SNRI (venlafaxine), atypical antidepressant (bupropion), MAOIs if appropriate, 3) Novel therapies: esketamine nasal spray (56-84mg twice weekly), TMS (repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation), ECT for severe cases. Biomaterial drug delivery innovations: 1) Implantable drug delivery systems for consistent medication levels, 2) Biodegradable polymer microspheres for extended-release formulations, 3) Targeted brain delivery using nanoparticle systems. Comprehensive plan: 1) Pharmacogenomic testing (CYP2D6, CYP2C19), 2) Optimize current medication + augmentation trial, 3) Consider esketamine if available, 4) TMS referral if medication refractory, 5) Intensive psychotherapy (DBT/CBT), 6) Lifestyle interventions, 7) Research protocol enrollment for novel biomaterial delivery systems."
