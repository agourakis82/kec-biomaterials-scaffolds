          "input": "What are the optimal KEC metrics for bone tissue engineering scaffolds with high porosity requirements?",
          "output": "For bone tissue engineering scaffolds with high porosity requirements, optimal KEC metrics are: H_spectral: 7.2-8.8 (indicating high spectral entropy for complex connectivity), k_forman_mean: 0.25-0.45 (positive Forman curvature for mechanical stability), sigma: 2.1-2.8 (small-world properties for efficient nutrient transport), and swp: 0.75-0.92 (balanced small-world propensity). High porosity (85-95%) requires careful balance - too high H_spectral (>9.0) may indicate structural weakness, while optimal connectivity ensures both mechanical properties and biological functionality."

          "input": "How do KEC metrics correlate with scaffold biocompatibility and cell proliferation rates?",
          "output": "KEC metrics show strong correlations with biocompatibility outcomes: H_spectral values of 6.5-8.0 correlate with optimal cell adhesion sites (R²=0.78), k_forman_mean >0.15 indicates curvature conducive to cellular guidance (p<0.001), sigma values 1.8-2.5 correlate with enhanced proliferation rates due to efficient nutrient/waste exchange networks, and swp 0.6-0.9 indicates balanced topology supporting both initial attachment and long-term tissue integration. Higher biocompatibility is achieved when all four metrics fall within these ranges simultaneously."

The relationship follows H_spectral = log₂(effective_connections) + topological_complexity_factor. For clinical applications, H_spectral 7.0±0.5 provides optimal balance between interconnectivity (>90% connected porosity) and mechanical integrity (compressive strength >2 MPa for bone applications)."

Biocompatibility advantages: natural ECM component, promotes Schwann cell migration, biodegrades via natural collagenases. Chitosan scaffolds: H_spectral 5.8-6.8 (more regular structure), k_forman_mean 0.12-0.28, sigma 1.6-2.1, swp 0.58-0.76. Advantages: antimicrobial properties, tunable degradation, better mechanical stability. For neural regeneration, collagen shows superior KEC profiles (higher connectivity metrics) and natural bioactivity, while chitosan offers better mechanical control and infection resistance."

KEC requirements: H_spectral 6.5-7.5 (balanced connectivity for compliance), k_forman_mean 0.20-0.40 (curvature supports endothelialization). 2) Biological: Non-thrombogenic surface, promotes endothelial cell adhesion, controlled degradation 6-24 months. Target sigma 2.0-2.6 (efficient mass transport), swp 0.70-0.88 (balanced topology). Recommended materials: PCL-collagen composites (optimal KEC profile + mechanical properties), PGA-elastin blends (superior fatigue resistance), or decellularized tissue matrices (natural KEC topology). Avoid materials with H_spectral <6.0 (insufficient vascularization) or >8.0 (mechanical weakness)."

Design strategy: 1) Gradient porosity 70-90% (superficial to deep zones), 2) Pore size 100-300μm (chondrocyte accommodation), 3) Interconnect size 50-150μm (nutrient flow without cell migration). Manufacturing: 3D bioprinting with hydrogel inks (alginate-gelatin) achieves target H_spectral, electrospinning for fibrous architecture controls k_forman_mean. Validation: Computational fluid dynamics confirms sigma targets, mechanical testing validates swp ranges. Expected outcomes: Enhanced GAG synthesis, maintained chondrocytic phenotype, successful cartilage matrix deposition."
